# BankingSolution
# In case the test case fails, run the failed ones individually, they will pass. It is because I have used the static data as a Dataset and all the test cases are sharing the test data, it may be the case that when one test case is running, the expected data does not match with Actual data as it is being modified by other test case. However, I have tried my best to create some additional test data to avoid such conflicts.
# this can be tested directly via swagger and also via test case.
# Docker compose file is also attached with this solution. By running a docker-compose up, this project will run on localhost:7000.
